Here’s a simplified, checklist-style plan for you to review before you begin working on your dataset and paper, based on the provided rubric:

### Go/No-Go Checks:
1. **Go/No-Go #1: R is cited**
   - [ ] Is R mentioned and properly referred to in the paper?
   - [ ] Is R included in the reference list?  
   If **no** to either, the paper gets 0 points.
   
2. **Go/No-Go #2: LLM usage is documented**
   - [ ] Does the README contain a paragraph or bullet point about whether LLMs or autocomplete tools like Copilot/Chat-GPT were used?
   - [ ] If tools like Chat-GPT were used, is the entire chat included in a text file?
   If **no**, the paper gets 0 points.
